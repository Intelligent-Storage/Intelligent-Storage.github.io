    <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: #6a6a5a; margin-bottom: 2rem;">A Tale from 2052</p>

  <div style="margin: 3rem 0; padding: 2rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(212, 165, 71, 0.1), rgba(212, 86, 140, 0.1)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid var(--golden-yellow);">

    <p>Dr. Helena Vance stood on the observation deck of the New Prometheus Research Station. She watched the rain come in veils across the rolling green landscape, pattering the enormous floor-to-ceiling window. Below, the atomic reactors hummed with limitless energy. Outside, sheep dotted and grey stone wills speckled the dark hills.</p>
    
    <p>The year was 2052. Nearly a hundred years prior the people had imagined cities of gleaming chrome spires, personal helicopters, and thinking machines that would elevate humanity to new heights of knowledge and leisure.</p>
    
    <p>But that future had not come to pass. The antithesis had nearly so. And it still could.</p>
    
    <p> "Professor," her assistant called from the doorway, "It's ready."</p>
    
    <p>No answer came. Only the atomic vibration and the drumming on the glass broke the silence.</p>
    
    <p>Helena touched the window, her reflection ghostly against the pane. This wasn't the future they'd been promised.</p>
    
    <p>Atomic energy had been virtually abandoned, a casualty of scientific illiteracy masquerading as environmentalism. Computers had become shackles, not tools of liberation. Worst of all, the thinking machines had indeed arrived. Yes, if that's what they could be called. But they'd caused something unexpected.</p>
    
    <p>"Professor?"</p>
    
    <p>"Yes," she replied at last, turning from the view, lab coat swirling. Little touched her these days, but even she was surprised to feel her heart pounding.</p>

    <p>"Will I...initiate?" asked the young Dr. Chen. The nervousness crept into his voice. He always wore his heart on his sleeve, but the strain in his face, the clenched jaw, showed he was doing his best not to.</p>

    <p>"No. I will do it." Helena advanced down the observation deck, metallic footsteps resounding on each stride.</p>
    
    <p>Maybe humanity didn't deserve this. Maybe humanity wasn't supposed to last. But, Helena smirked, her mouth fading to a sad, knowing smile. To give up would not be human, and that would mean it was already over.</p>

    <p>Dr. Chen, needing to fill the silence, spoke. "I know we've always said it was a coincidence that it should be here. But it seems like a bad joke now that it's finally about to happen."</p>
    
    <p>Helena stopped. "They ironically called this place 'Intelligent Storage,' based on the original research, of course. But the records claim there was no evidence for the theory. Impossible to know if that's what we're <i>intended</i> to believe. Now, it's a repository for an old dream. And in a moment we shall put the coincidence to the test." </p>

    <p>The name New Prometheus Research Station was misleading. Though there had been additions and renovations, in the end it was still a retrofitted facility. A very old facility, in fact.</p>
  
    <p>"We have forgotten too much," Helena continued. "Come now. We haven't much time."</p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">Welcome to my blog. Years ago I came across this quote, and have never been able to get it out of my head: </p>

    <blockquote style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); border-left: 4px solid var(--retro-pink); font-style: italic;">
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">It is a mark of scientific genius to be sensitive to difficulties where less gifted people pass by untroubled with doubt.</p>

    </blockquote

    <p style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">I'm no genius, so this place is an attempt to cultivate such <i>sensitivities</i>. It is a playground for my mind, and hopefully a place for independent thoughts.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.1em; margin-top: 1.5rem; font-style: italic;">Thanks for reading.</p>
