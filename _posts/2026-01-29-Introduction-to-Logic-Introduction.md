## What is the project?
This aim of this project is to provide solutions to the text An Introduction to Logic and Scientific Method, an _undergraduate_ textbook first published in 1934. The authors are [Morris F. Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Raphael_Cohen) and [Ernest Nagel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Nagel).

## Why?

Why work through a textbook published **91 years ago**? (it is 2026 as of this writing)
Why work through material considered dated by modern logicians?

The short, real reason is there is simply the drive to do so. And in doing so, I have become convinced of responses to other possible 'whys' that might surround this project. 

## How did this start?

I became aware of this textbook after having an urge to study _logic_. This came about during a winter break more than a decade ago while on a Sherlock Holmes binge. _Logic_ in the
Holmesian sense (i.e. Holmesian Logic) has always fascinated me, resembling something of a mystical art. If only i could be _truly_ logical, then the world would open up to me
in ways never before.

Oddly, logic is one thing we are always told do or be (Be logical, use common sense, ...) and yet, never explicitly taught in school. In university I learned a little
about logic, but this experience felt like it put a lie to the word. What do logic gates and truth tables really have to do with practical life outside of electronic
circuit and code design? Wasn't _logic_ supposed to be a mode of thinking and understanding?

Logic therefore has always held this aura and aesthetic appeal, unblemished my university experience by it. Clearly, I thought, what Sherlock Holmes was using (even if in a fictional story)
had little to do with what was being taught. I wanted to understand the _real logic_.

I searched for classic texts on logic and an Introduction to Logic and Scientific Method was one of the first books that came up. It had few reviews, but all good. One of them stated:


<div style="margin: 3rem 0; padding: 2rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(212, 165, 71, 0.1), rgba(212, 86, 140, 0.1)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid var(--golden-yellow);">
<p style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">After reading and studying it, I shall never be the same. Cohen's work is permanent life-changing...It may be unfortunate to read and absorb as, at least in my life's experience, you can never get back out of it...Looking back on Cohen's Logic & Scientific Method, it is the single most important book I have ever read.

Yes please! This is the book I want!

But I was not prepared for the evolution and differences in the English language from nearly a hundred years ago to today. Nor the denseness, and succinctness of the authors. 
Nor the difficulty in the material itself. A frustrating difficulty with logical connections that seem so obvious - yet, to be consciously
aware of the underlying implications and defining them - a thing not so easily done.

So, what I once thought would be a text to be read through once, imparting some form of significant and immediate enlightenment, has instead become, well, absolutely nothing of the sort.

I have yet to read through this offending book even once, but have attempted multiple times, reading and re-reading certain chapters again and again. Fighting the end chapter questions, sometimes without resolution.

And I have realized so far the following:

1. There is a certain beauty of the English language from the 1930s, especially from excellent writers, that we have forgotten. For this alone it is worth reading and studying, if for nothing else, to improve my own command of the language.
2. There are fundamentals of scientific research that we skimp over in modern formal education - today one need must know to code, to run statistics properly, how to write papers - yet apparently, understanding how to do proper science at a
fundamental level is not. It's assumed we have it, yet I have seen experienced research struggle to differentiate between hypothesis testing and observation. (In fairness, I also find boundaries to this division blurred today with shared datasets - discussion for another time)
3. Modern education is void of a classical education (i.e. the Greeks) and this makes understanding references, even in a logic textbook, difficult. I want to know what else we have lost which the past generation found important to learn.
4. There are no solutions to this text online. I'm not even sure if any actual solutions from the original authors still exist in the world. So for this, I intend to complete this. To find something we have forgotten. And we have forgotten so much.


I know not if the effort for this project will ultimately be fruitful, or if my proposed solutions will be correct (certainly some portion will not be). But, I believe with dedicated effort
working through this text may impart beneficial change to myself, my way of dissecting problems, ultimately, my mode of consideration.
