I have updated some of the answers after reviewing them again.

# THE SUBJECT MATTER OF LOGIC

## Question 1

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(212, 165, 71, 0.1), rgba(212, 86, 140, 0.1)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #d4a547;">

1. Is it on the basis of immediate knowledge or on evidence that you know:

a. that there is a center of the earth?  
b. that there is a king of Italy?  
c. that you have lungs with which you breathe?  
d. that there is a Belgian Congo?  
e. that there is a country called Tibet between India and China?

</div>

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(99, 179, 237, 0.08), rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.08)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #63b3ed;">

**Answer:**

1a. Evidence: It is only with evidence I know the earth is round, and therefore has a center.

1b. Evidence: It is only with the aid of the internet, being 2024, that I was able to determine that in 1936 (year of publication) that there was a king of Italy.

1c. Evidence: Given that I have never seen the lungs inside my body, or the function of lung cells beneath a microscrope, it is only through textbooks and instruction that I have lungs with which I breathe.

1d. Evidence: Again, it is only through an internet search I was able to learn there was a Belgian Congo which existed at the time of this book's publication.

1e. Evidence: I have never been to Tibet, and know of its existence through 2nd hand sources.

</div>

## Question 2

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(212, 165, 71, 0.1), rgba(212, 86, 140, 0.1)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #d4a547;">

2. What evidence have you for the belief that a remote ancestor of yours must have lived in 2000 B.C.? or that Washington, Napoleon, King Arthur, King David, Homer, or Moseses lived on this earth?

</div>

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(99, 179, 237, 0.08), rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.08)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #63b3ed;">

**Answer:**

Updated: This question pre-supposes two items: 1) that I had a remote ancestor 2) the year 2000 B.C. existed.

Concerning the belief of a remote ancestor having lived in the year 2,000 B.C., I have direct evidence of my existence, and the existence of my parents and my grandparents. I have 2nd hand evidence through them that my grandparents had parents and grandparents before them. This evidence supports the idea that I have ancestors, who also had ancestors, and so on. From personal observation and through instruction, I also have the evidence that humans do not appear from nowhere, and are only created from previously existing beings. If I exist today, it is because I had an ancestor (my parents) who had ancestors before them, and so it must be long period of time. If humans existed in 2,000 BC, and I exist today, then this evidence suggests an ancestor of my existed then. The evidence I have for 2,000 BC existing are the historical records, human ruins, and carbon dating which indicate humans existed well before 2,000 BC.

Concerning the persons above, for both Washington and Napoleon there are many artifacts of their existence and during their lives contemporary paintings of the. The location of their tombs and remains are also known. Specifically for Napoleon, there is DNA evidence linking him to living descendants.

For King Arthur, King David, Homer, and Moses, the evidence for their existence is through oral or written traditions only.

</div>

## Question 3

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(212, 165, 71, 0.1), rgba(212, 86, 140, 0.1)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #d4a547;">

3. Prove that 5 + 2 = 7. Formulate all the assumptions involved in this proof. (See Poincaré, The Foundations of Science, pp. 34-42)

</div>

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(99, 179, 237, 0.08), rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.08)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #63b3ed;">

**Answer:**

I define the numbers 5 and 7 by the equalities:

(1) 1 + 1 = 2  
(2) 1 + 2 = 3  
(3) 2 + 3 = 5  
(4) 3 + 3 + 1 = 7

I define the operation x + 1 as being the addition of the number 1 to a given number x

I define the operation x + a as being the addition of the number a to a given number x

If we define the operation x + (a-1) where (a-1) is the predecessor of a then  
(5) x + a = [x + (a – 1)] + 1

We therefore know by recurrence what x + a is as we can define successive operations from x + 1, i.e.

x + 1 = [x + (1 – 1)] + 1 = x + 1  
x + 2 = [x + (2 – 1)] + 1 = [x + 1] + 1 (i.e. the successor to x + 1)  
x + 3 = [x + (3 – 1)] + 1 = [x + 2] + 1 (i.e. the successor to x + 2)  
And so on

Therefore 5 + 2 = 7

</div>

## Question 4

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(212, 165, 71, 0.1), rgba(212, 86, 140, 0.1)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #d4a547;">

4. What is meant by saying that logic is formal?

</div>

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(99, 179, 237, 0.08), rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.08)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #63b3ed;">

**Answer:**

Logical implication is independent of specific characteristics of any objects noted in or by a proposition, only the necessary connection, the implication between proposition for a given object matters. Therefore, logic is formal because it can take into account varying propositions and consider various objects and characteristics, so long as a certain relation exists. The validity of any assertion of implication between a set of propositions is not dependent on the objects or characteristics within them, but upon their overall structure.

For instance:

Ireland is a country  
All countries have a capital  
∴Ireland has a capital

This can be replaced by the form:

X is a Y  
All Ys have a Z  
∴X has a Z

Whereas:

Ireland is a country  
All counties have a capital (counties NOT countries)  
∴Ireland has a capital

Which can be substituted by the form:

X is a Y  
All Cs have a Z  
∴ X has a Z

Which is not valid because there is no valid implication between propositions 1 and 2.

</div>

## Question 5

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(212, 165, 71, 0.1), rgba(212, 86, 140, 0.1)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #d4a547;">

5. Examine the proof that: A² + b² = (a+b)(a-b)

</div>

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(99, 179, 237, 0.08), rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.08)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #63b3ed;">

**Answer:** N/A

</div>

## Question 6

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(212, 165, 71, 0.1), rgba(212, 86, 140, 0.1)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #d4a547;">

6. State the propositions necessary to prove:

a. that the earth is round,  
b. that it revolves around its axis and also around the sun

</div>

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(99, 179, 237, 0.08), rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.08)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #63b3ed;">

**Answer:**

a. (Answer from 2024) The earth is a 3 dimensional object. The outermost potential boundaries of any 3 dimensional object can be determined by 3 perpendicular views which contain those boundaries in frame. There exist 3 perpendicular views of the earth (by satellite imagery). Each perpendicular of earth view reveals a 2D circle. If all three perpendicular views reveal a 2D circle, then the earth's outermost boundaries are that of a sphere. If the earth's outermost shape is a sphere, then it is round.

(Answer from 1936)

b. N/A

</div>

## Question 7

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(212, 165, 71, 0.1), rgba(212, 86, 140, 0.1)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #d4a547;">

7. What evidence is there that under the present Constitution a President of the United States might be elected by a minority vote?

</div>

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(99, 179, 237, 0.08), rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.08)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #63b3ed;">

**Answer:**

In the history of the USA, pre-1936, there are three instances in which a President won the election without having the popular vote (i.e. the majority vote). These are in 1824 when John Quincy Adams won, 1876 with Rutherford B. Hayes, and 1888 with Benjamin Harris. Since the constitution has not changed, these are 3 instances where a president has been elected despite having a minority vote (for the popular vote, not the electoral college vote).

</div>

## Question 8

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(212, 165, 71, 0.1), rgba(212, 86, 140, 0.1)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #d4a547;">

8. Are the following arguments valid?

a. San Francisco is West of New York.  
Peking is west of San Francisco.  
Berlin is west of Peking.  
∴Berlin is west of San Francisco.

b. A is the right of B.  
B is to the right of C.  
∴ A is to the right of C.  
Is this true of people sitting in a circle?

</div>

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(99, 179, 237, 0.08), rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.08)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #63b3ed;">

**Answer:**

a. No, because the determinant for whether something is west or east on the globe is for the direction which is shortest. It is a shorter route east from San Francisco to Berlin, therefore 'Berlin is east of San Francisco'.

b. This is valid depending on the frame of reference and situation. If considering a straight line, this is valid. This can be true of people sitting in a circle if the frame of reference is directly above. If considering the perspective from each individual, then it is not.

</div>

## Question 9

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(212, 165, 71, 0.1), rgba(212, 86, 140, 0.1)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #d4a547;">

9. Is the following a valid argument simply because premises and conclusion are true?

a. Fish live in water.  
Monkeys are not fish.  
∴ Moneys do not live in water.

b. Compare with:  
Fish live in water.  
Whales are not fish.  
∴ Whales do not live in water.

</div>

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(99, 179, 237, 0.08), rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.08)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #63b3ed;">

**Answer:**

a. This is not a valid argument. Just because "monkeys" are not fish does not mean they don't live in water. There are other things for instance which are not fish, but do live in water, like whales.

b. This is not a valid argument. Just because something is not a fish, does not mean it does not live in water.

For both of these, exclusion from being part of a group of objects (fish) does not exclude them from the characteristics (lives in water) that may pertain to that group of objects.

</div>

## Question 10

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(212, 165, 71, 0.1), rgba(212, 86, 140, 0.1)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #d4a547;">

10. Examine the following as to their validity:

a. All lions are fierce.  
Some lions do not drink coffee.  
∴ Some creatures that drink coffee are not fierce.

b. Some pillows are soft.  
No pokers are soft.  
∴ Some pokers are not pillows.

c. No bankrupts are rich.  
Some merchants are not bankrupts.  
∴ Some merchants are rich.

d. No emperors are dentists.  
All dentists are dreaded by children.  
∴ No emperors are dreaded by children.

e. All the clever boys got prizes.  
All the hard-working boys got prizes.  
∴ All the clever boys were hard-working.

f. All liberals hold these opinions.  
He holds these opinions.  
∴ He is a liberal.

</div>

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(99, 179, 237, 0.08), rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.08)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #63b3ed;">

**Answer:**

a. Not valid. The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises tell us about lions and coffee, but the conclusion makes a claim about creatures that drink coffee.

b. Valid. If some pillows are soft and no pokers are soft, then those pokers cannot be pillows.

c. Not valid. Just because some merchants are not bankrupts doesn't mean they are rich. There could be other states between bankrupt and rich.

d. Not valid. The conclusion doesn't follow. Even if no emperors are dentists, emperors could still be dreaded by children for other reasons.

e. Not valid. Both groups got prizes, but this doesn't mean there's an overlap between clever and hard-working boys.

f. Not valid. This is the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Others besides liberals might also hold these opinions.

</div>

## Question 11

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(212, 165, 71, 0.1), rgba(212, 86, 140, 0.1)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #d4a547;">

11. Discuss the following as to their validity:

a. If war is declared, the enemy country will be invaded.  
But war is not declared.  
∴ The enemy country will not be invaded.

b. If a number is divisible by 4, it is even.  
It is not even.  
∴ It is not divisible by 4.

c. If the street is sprinkled, there is no dust in the air.  
The street is not sprinkled.  
∴ There is dust in the air.

d. Either the child is ill or it is spoiled.  
But the child is ill.  
∴ It is not spoiled.

e. If he fulfills his election promises, he will be a popular mayor.  
He will be a popular mayor.  
∴ He will fulfill his election promises.

f. If he was born in Paris, he cannot become a cabinet officer.  
He was born in Paris.  
∴ He cannot become a cabinet officer.

g. Either he is indifferent or he is forgetful.  
He is not forgetful.  
∴ He is indifferent.

</div>

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(99, 179, 237, 0.08), rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.08)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #63b3ed;">

**Answers:**

a. Not valid. (Denying the antecedent fallacy)

b. Valid. (Modus tollens)

c. Not valid. (Denying the antecedent fallacy)

d. Not valid. (The "or" could be inclusive, so both could be true)

e. Not valid. (Affirming the consequent fallacy)

f. Valid. (Modus ponens)

g. Valid. (Disjunctive syllogism)

</div>

## Question 12

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(212, 165, 71, 0.1), rgba(212, 86, 140, 0.1)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #d4a547;">

12. Examine the following arguments:

a. Ninety-nine Cretans in a hundred are liars.  
Epimenides is a Cretan.  
∴ Epimenides is a liar.

b. Minos, Sarpedon, Rhadamantus, Deucalion, and Epimenides are all the Cretans I know.  
They were all atrocious liars.  
∴ Pretty much all Cretans must have been liars.

c. All the beans taken from bag A are white.  
These beans are white.  
∴ These beans are from bag A.

</div>

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(99, 179, 237, 0.08), rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.08)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #63b3ed;">

**Answers:**

a. Not valid (but probable). This is inductive reasoning based on statistical probability, not deductive validity.

b. Not valid. This is hasty generalization from a small sample size to an entire population.

c. Not valid. This is the fallacy of affirming the consequent. White beans could come from other bags.

</div>

## Question 13

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(212, 165, 71, 0.1), rgba(212, 86, 140, 0.1)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #d4a547;">

13. Distinguish between inference and implication.

</div>

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(99, 179, 237, 0.08), rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.08)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #63b3ed;">

**Answer:**

Inference is temporal, whereas implication is not. Implication deals with the objective relation between propositions.

Note: In 2024 the meaning for 'implication' and 'inference' appear to have swapped, as implication is now defined as 'the conclusion that can be drawn from something although it is not explicitly stated.' (Via Oxford Dictionary)

</div>

## Question 14

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(212, 165, 71, 0.1), rgba(212, 86, 140, 0.1)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #d4a547;">

14. What is the difference between logic and grammar, logic and psychology, logic and physics?

</div>

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(99, 179, 237, 0.08), rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.08)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #63b3ed;">

**Answer:** 

Logic is the study of the weight of evidence. Grammar is the study of semantics, psychology the study of the mind, and physics is the study of matter and energy.

</div>

## Question 15

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(212, 165, 71, 0.1), rgba(212, 86, 140, 0.1)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #d4a547;">

15. In Book IV, Chapter XVII of his Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Locke comments as follows upon the value of the study of formal logic:

"If syllogisms must be taken for the only proper instrument of reason and means of knowledge, it will follow that, before Aristotle, there was not one man that did or could know anything by reason; and that, since the invention of syllogisms, there is not one of ten thousand that doth. But God has not been so sparing to men to make them barely two-legged creatures, and left it to Aristotle to make them rational."

Examine the force of this jibe against Aristotle.

For further study: L. S. Stebbing, Modern Introduction to Logic, 1930, Chap. I; John Dewey, How We Think, new ed., 1933, Pt. II; John Venn, Principles of Empirical or Inductive Logic, 2d ed., Chap. 5, Sec. 1.

</div>

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(99, 179, 237, 0.08), rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.08)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #63b3ed;">

**Answer:** 

Locke is insinuating that it is nonsensical to think that reasoning can only come about from syllogism since it was Aristotle (presumably) who developed this method. Therefore, anyone before Aristotle could not have reasoned since they did not have the syllogism to help them. Yet, man can not have been said to be "non-reasonable" before this, and as Locke shows, there are ways to reasoning outside of syllogism, such as his own quote just above. What Locke misses, at least in the quoted text, is that proper reasoning, that is reasoning with fully certainty, is done easily with syllogisms and more so, that full certainty is such a rare thing. To be right most of the time is of great importance, even if not valid by the rules of certain syllogisms.
