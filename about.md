## Who am I?

<div style="margin: 3rem 0; padding: 2rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(212, 165, 71, 0.1), rgba(212, 86, 140, 0.1)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid var(--golden-yellow);">
  <p style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">Nobody.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">Having reputation and identity permits a punishing cost of failure.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">Anonymity provides wings to creativity, a catalyst for experimentation.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">Content matters. Not who I am.</p>

## Why this Retro-Future theme?

<div style="margin: 3rem 0; padding: 2rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(212, 165, 71, 0.1), rgba(212, 86, 140, 0.1)); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid var(--golden-yellow);">
  <p style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">The "Retro-Future" theme stems from the science-fiction stories and imagery from the 1940s and 1950s. It was not only a time of boundless faith in progress, but of optimism, hope, and wonder for the technology to come. Of course, not all carried this positivism. Some warned of the dangers ahead.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">Today, some 75 years later, the anticipation for improvement has been replaced with skepticism, wariness, and distrust. Technology that once promised increased agency, leisure, and ease of life now weighs like a ball-and-chain shackle. The computational power to land a rocket on the moon is carried by nearly every human in their pocket, yet none use it for such a noble purpose.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">There is something melancholic about losing that sense of wonder. Of unlimited atomic energy, fantastic architecture, thinking machines and computers that we would use to discover and learn, improve ourselves—not to be used by them and become the product.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8; font-weight: 600; color: var(--retro-pink);">This blog is an attempt to reclaim that agency, and rediscover that wonder.</p>
